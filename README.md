# Kuko (kukothecuban) | Web3 Resilience Advocate & Self-Taught Builder

### **A Builder Forged in Extreme Adversity (Un Constructor Forjado en la Adversidad Extrema)**

I am Rodney Enrique Garcés Martín, a Cuban citizen,a 20  years  carpenter by profession , and **self-taught Web3 apprentice**. My journey is a testament to resilience: I dedicated over 2 year, working **24/7**, teaching myself coding, blockchain, and English—all to recover from devastating financial losses and crypto scams.

This fight is personal and takes place under extreme duress:

* **Medical Battle:** I have suffered severe vision loss due to excessive screen time and now require all lights off, making development profoundly difficult.
* **Financial Collapse:** I have lost my truck loan, face eviction next month (as evidenced by my notice), and have estranged friends who do not believe in crypto,than make the imposible to see me wrst in this country after i kick out of them bc they just want me to changed mi mind about crypto and tradingas in canada is not culture of crypto yet
* **Legal/Immigration:** I am currently in a custody battle with my ex-spouse, who suspended my sponsorship, leaving me with only my US Green Card and limited access to financial services in Canada.

I pursue this work to secure a better life for my family under a regime in Cuba and for my son here in Canada. This hardship only fuels my mission: to create a secure, equal system where abusive platforms cannot manipulate the most vulnerable.

### **Skills Forged in Adversity**

I built and manage my entire infrastructure, deploying and operating systems that only seasoned developers typically handle, forcing me to put in **double the effort** due to language barriers.

| Achievement (Battle Won) | Demonstrated Expertise (Proof) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Accounts & Pimlico** | Built and manage **7 independent wallets**. Integrated Safe Smart Wallets with Pimlico. Approved Sepolia validator; ran a **Beacon chain node**and i was running my own node until the attacts started, first in sepolia form 3 months and after in mainnet for just one moth,  without formal developer training. |
| **EIP-712 Cryptographic Proof** | Successfully created and submitted the EIP-712 Signature (Nonce 0) to Safe Support, irrefutably proving ownership against their "demo wallet" claim. |
| **Staking Disputes (Beacon/Lido)** | Six years of non-stop staking (ETH, COSMO, STARS). Successfully identified and internally changed my staking profile address after identifying **$20K ETH** being systematically routed away via a malicious revert transaction, preventing all withdrawals. |
| **Infrastructure** | Personally deployed **ERC-20 contracts** on mainnetand wasm contract in injectiosn  (`0xE5e8...` and `0x5DDC...`). Expert in Etherscan and Mintscan. |
| **Resilience Against Attack** | Maintained my work after exposing flaws to Git and receiving **millions of attacks** that broke my computer's motherboard, resulting in a four-month downtime. |

### **Current Mission: Accountability & Unblocking Funds**

My primary focus is the ongoing abuse by **Safe Wallet**, who have labeled my active, funded wallet (`0xfF501B324DC6d78dC9F983f140B9211c3EdB4dc7`) as a "demo" for over two years, preventing me from withdrawing crucial funds.

**Technical Blockade:** I possess the JSON data proving my profile address change on Beacon/Lido, but attempts to submit the final JSON data (via ethdo, prism, web3sign, curl, or Beacon broadcast) consistently fail due to unknown errors—likely related to my motherboard replacement, as the system may no longer recognize me as the same user. **I need help solving this core technical issue.**

#### **A Warning to New Users:**

**I strongly advise beginners against using complex Smart Wallets like Safe Wallet.** My experience shows these powerful solutions quickly become a trap where you are locked out, support is hostile, and technical transparency is non-existent.

### **🙏 Special Acknowledgment and Public Commitment**

**To the Dev Team and Git Community who have supported me:** A heartfelt thank you for your help, patience, and for witnessing the evidence in real-time.

**Regarding Public Repositories:** My repositories remain hidden, not out of fear, but out of **strategic necessity**. Having exposed theft on Beacon, I suffered devastating attacks that required replacing my motherboard. Until I can afford a new, dedicated machine with better defenses, I cannot risk losing my only working computer. I appreciate your understanding and continued support as I work toward that goal.

### **Find Me & Verify My Work**

I am ready to provide full KYC, proof of wallet ownership, and private repo details to anyone willing to help or collaborate on a transparent project.
